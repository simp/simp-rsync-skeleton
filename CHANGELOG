* Fri Oct 23 2020 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 7.0.4-0
- Modernized the README for tftpboot files. It now explains
  which boot files for the tftpboot server are required when
  `tftpboot:use_os_files` is set to `false`.

* Wed Sep 23 2020 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 7.0.3-0
- Fixed a bug in which the name of the rndc key in the sample named.conf
  files did not match the name of the automatically-generated key in
  /etc/rndc.key. This mismatch would prevent the named service from starting.

* Tue Dec 17 2019 Michael Morrone <michael.morrone@onyxpoint.com> - 7.0.2-0
- Added mitigation for CVE-2019-6477 to RedHat 7 named.conf 

* Tue Nov 19 2019 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 7.0.2-0

  stub for not removing files that are currently in place upon system upgrade.
- Updated Rsync to install under the skeleton directory instead
  of in the active environment directories.

* Mon Mar 25 2019 Jim Anderson <thesemicolons@protonmail.com> - 6.3.0-0

* Thu Apr 26 2018 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 6.2.1-0
- Added logic in dhcpd.conf to select the appropriate PXEboot file
  based on the boot type (BIOS or UEFI).

* Thu Oct 26 2017 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 6.2.0-0
- The selinux policy in simp-environment was changing settings on rsync
  files not in the simp environment.  If DNS and DHCP were running in an
  environment other then simp, relabeling the filesystem would change the
  selinux context to default context for /var/simp. This, in turn, caused
  these services to fail if selinux was in enforcing mode.
- The selinux policy and the logic to set it up were moved to simp-environment module
  so the selinux policy for /var/simp directory would be in one spot.
- Simp-rsync now requires the simp-environment

* Wed Jul 31 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> 4.0.1-9
- Updated the SELinux file contexts to support the case where named is
  chrooted and the system is in permissive mode. The previous release
  would continually restart named.

* Mon May 13 2013 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> 4.0.1-8
- Added SELinux policies to the package to cover clamav, dhcpd,

* Tue Nov 20 2012 Maintenance 4.0.1-3
